# This playbook deploys Openwhisk Invokers.

- hosts: invokers
  vars:
    #
    # host_group - usually "{{ groups['...'] }}" where '...' is what was used
    #   for 'hosts' above.  The hostname of each host will be looked up in this
    #   group to assign a zero-based index.  That index will be used in concert
    #   with 'name_prefix' below to assign a host/container name.
    host_group: "{{ groups['invokers'] }}"
    #
    # name_prefix - a unique prefix for this set of invokers.  The prefix
    #   will be used in combination with an index (determined using
    #   'host_group' above) to name host/invokers.
    name_prefix: "invoker"
    #
    # invoker_index_base - the deployment process allocates host docker
    #   ports to individual invokers based on their indices.  This is an
    #   additional offset to prevent collisions between different invoker
    #   groups. Usually 0 if only one group is being deployed, otherwise
    #   something like "{{ groups['firstinvokergroup']|length }}"
